	 <div class="button1"><div class="screen1">Make your passwords secure<br><br> The most common password in the world is “password”, followed by “123456”. Easy to remember, but also easy to guess. A longer, more secure password makes it more difficult for hackers (who probably use bots) to break into your account. The site howsecureismypassword.net estimates how long it will take a bot to guess your password.
</div></div>
	 <div class="button2"><div class="screen2">Don’t use the same password for all your accounts <br><br> This is pretty obvious. If someone gets ahold of one of your passwords, they can then access all your accounts. The site haveibeenpwned.com shows you if any of your passwords have been leaked due to a privacy breach.
</div></div>
	 <div class="button3"><div class="screen3">Don’t post everything online<br><br>  Facebook already tracks everything you post. Along the way, it might be easy to figure out some of your best-kept secrets if you post everything that’s happening to you. Job recruiters might look you up on Facebook and see things that you don’t want them to know. As they say, nothing in the Internet can be deleted.
</div></div>
	 <div class="button4"><div class="screen4">Install antivirus software <br><br> Your computer or laptop holds a lot of files. Some of these files could be very personal, sensitive or important. You certainly don’t want your computer to be hacked or encrypted if this is the case. One way to remedy this is to install up-to-date antivirus software that blocks many different types of viruses.</div></div>

    Is It All Worth It?

    “If you have nothing to hide, then you have nothing to fear”. This is a pretty popular saying, commonly uttered by many who couldn’t care less about protecting their personal information. But somewhere down the road, that one tweet about how you really, really hate dogs could become your demise one day. People could use your info in ways which you never would ever have thought of. Data privacy is something that shouldn’t be neglected - and for very good reasons. Your information is yours - not your friend’s, your brother’s, or your jowa’s - it’s yours. And you need to take the steps to keep it yours.
